            This is our systems' about us page. We collectively go by the Spellbinder System or SBS for short.
            We have 27 currently active members, including those in a subsystem. Bodily we are turning 26 and
            are a Jewish transgender lesbian woman. We are traumagenic in origin, and found out as such in early 2025,
            though we have apparently been a system since early childhood. Yay trauma /sarcasm

            duckduckgo searching.
